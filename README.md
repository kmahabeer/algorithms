## Daily Problem-Solving Practice

### Overview

This repository showcases my goal of improving my problem-solving skills in various programming languages. I attempt to solve coding challenges each day, using Python and C/C++, and occassionally JavaScript. This daily practice helps me develop problem-solving patterns that can be applied to other programming challenges, such as MATLAB development, and embedded programming.
